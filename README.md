# lean-autosubst

[![Lean](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lean-v4.30.0-blue)](lean-toolchain)

A self-contained Lean 4 port of [Autosubst 2](https://github.com/uds-psl/autosubst2): the de Bruijn
substitution boilerplate generator. You write a HOAS specification of your syntax in a small DSL
inside your `.lean` file, and an elaboration-time metaprogram synthesizes — as **real Lean
declarations, typechecked by the kernel in-process** — the de Bruijn inductive types, the
renaming/substitution operations, the full equational lemma tower, and the `asimp` simp set that
discharges substitution goals.

Unlike the Coq/OCaml Autosubst, there is **no external tool and no generated source text**: the
`autosubst` command *is* the generator, and the kernel is the correctness oracle (a generated lemma
that does not typecheck is a generator bug surfaced immediately). No Mathlib dependency.

- **Two backends from one spec** — unscoped (`Nat`-indexed) and well-scoped (`Fin`-indexed).
- **Multi-sorted, mutually-recursive syntax** with parallel substitutions (System F, CBV, …).
- **Nested containers** (`List`, `Option`, `Prod`, *or your own inductive*) threaded automatically,
  recognised on demand — no registration, no `deriving`.
- **The complete tactic set** — `asimp` / `substify` / `renamify` / `auto_unfold`.
- **Autosubst-consistent notations** — `s[σ]`, `s⟨ξ⟩`, `⇑σ`, `[t/]`, … (opt-in).
- **Axiom-clean** — the entire generated tower uses only `propext` and `Quot.sound`.

```lean
import LeanAutosubst
open Autosubst Autosubst.Notation

autosubst
  ty where
    | Base : ty
    | Fun  : ty → ty → ty
  tm where
    | app : tm → tm → tm
    | lam : ty → (bind tm in tm) → tm

-- Everything below `autosubst` is generated. The substitution lemma, proved automatically:
example (σ : Nat → tm) (t s : tm) :
    (s[t/])[σ] = (s[⇑σ])[t[σ]/] := by asimp
```

## Installation

Add the dependency to your `lakefile.toml`:

```toml
[[require]]
name = "lean-autosubst"
git  = "https://github.com/qcfu-bu/lean-autosubst.git"
rev  = "main"
```

or, with a Lean `lakefile.lean`:

```lean
require «lean-autosubst» from git
  "https://github.com/qcfu-bu/lean-autosubst.git" @ "main"
```

then `import LeanAutosubst`. Your project's `lean-toolchain` must match the one pinned here
([`leanprover/lean4:v4.30.0`](lean-toolchain)).

## The DSL

### The command: `autosubst` and `autosubst wellscoped`

```lean
autosubst              -- unscoped: variables are `Nat`, `var_tm : Nat → tm`
autosubst wellscoped   -- well-scoped: variables are `Fin n`, `var_tm : Fin n → tm n`
  <sort> where
    | <ctor> : <arg> → … → <sort>
    | …
  <sort> where …       -- one block per syntactic sort; mutually-recursive sorts are detected
```

The block *reads* like (mutual) Lean `inductive`s, but it is **never elaborated as one** — it is
captured as syntax, lowered to a first-order de Bruijn inductive (binders erased), and only that
strictly-positive inductive reaches the kernel. So `bind`-annotated "function arrows" never become
real function types and positivity is a non-issue. Constructor arrows may be written with either the
unicode `→` or ASCII `->` (the two may be mixed), exactly as in Lean.

* **Unscoped** (default) — `tm : Type`, `var_tm : Nat → tm`, `lam : ty → tm → tm`.
* **Well-scoped** (`wellscoped`) — each substitution sort is indexed by one `Nat` per kind of
  variable it carries: `tm : Nat → Type`, `var_tm : Fin n → tm n`, `lam : ty → tm (n+1) → tm n`.
  Scope indices are auto-bound implicits.

Sort declarations may also carry ordinary Lean-style parameters. Explicit, implicit, strict
implicit, and instance binders are preserved on the generated inductive. Generated
operations/lemmas rebind ordinary parameters implicitly so calls stay compact, while instance
parameters stay instance-implicit:

```lean
universe u v

autosubst
  Ty {Srt : Type u} (Ann : Type v) [BEq Srt] where
    | base : Srt → Ty
    | tag  : Ann → Ty

  Tm {Srt : Type u} (Ann : Type v) [BEq Srt] where
    | ann   : Tm → Ty Srt Ann → Tm     -- explicit sort application
    | plain : Ty → Tm                  -- bare `Ty` means `Ty Srt Ann`
    | ext   : opaque(Thunk Srt Ann) → Tm
```

All sorts in one mutual `autosubst` block currently share the same parameter telescope. The
`opaque(e)` wrapper accepts an arbitrary Lean type expression and treats it as a foreign leaf field:
renaming/substitution carry it unchanged and do not inspect it for sort occurrences.

Ambient `section` variables mentioned in the DSL are captured automatically as sort parameters, along
with any section variables their types depend on. Instance section variables are captured when their
class type depends on an already-captured variable:

```lean
section
variable (Srt : Type u)
variable [BEq Srt]

autosubst
  Tm where
    | atom : Srt → Tm        -- elaborates as if `Tm (Srt : Type u) [BEq Srt]` had been written
    | lam  : (bind Tm in Tm) → Tm
end
```

### Binders: `bind a in h` and `bind a, b in h`

A constructor argument that binds variables wraps its head type in a `bind … in …` annotation:

```lean
| lam   : ty → (bind tm in tm) → tm          -- `lam`'s body binds one `tm` variable
| tlam  : (bind ty in tm) → tm               -- a *cross-sort* binder: binds a `ty` in a `tm`
| split : tm → (bind tm, tm in tm) → tm      -- simultaneous binding of TWO variables (Σ-/pair elim)
```

`bind a, b in h` binds several variables **at once** in the same position — substitution lifts once
per binder (`up ∘ up …`); in well-scoped mode the body's scope jumps accordingly (`tm (n+1+1)`). See
[LeanAutosubst/Examples/PairBindDsl.lean](LeanAutosubst/Examples/PairBindDsl.lean).

### Container heads `F a` and external types

A substitutable sort may be nested inside a container — `List`, `Option`, `Prod`, **or any inductive
of your own** — and substitution threads through it automatically. Container application is plain
juxtaposition, exactly as in Lean — no parentheses at the top level; parentheses are needed only to
*nest* one application inside another (just as `List (Option α)` needs them in Lean):

```lean
| seq : List tm → tm                    -- substitution maps over the list
| opt : Option tm → tm
| pr  : Prod tm tm → tm                 -- i.e. `tm × tm`
| brs : List (Prod tm tm) → tm          -- nesting needs the inner parens
| lam : (bind tm in List tm) → tm       -- a binder *into* a container
```

`List`/`Option`/`Prod` are **not privileged** — they are recognised by an **on-demand** check, the
same one your own types go through. When `autosubst` meets a head `F …`, it reads `F`'s declaration:
if `F` is a *regular polynomial functor* in its type parameters (each constructor argument is a type
parameter, a uniform recursive occurrence, or a parameter-free/inert type), substitution threads
through every applied argument that contains substitutable syntax. So you just *use* your container
— **no registration, no `deriving`, nothing to write**:

```lean
inductive Tree (α : Type) | leaf : α → Tree α | node : Tree α → Tree α → Tree α

autosubst
  tm where
    | branch : Tree tm → tm            -- threads through `Tree` automatically — `Tree` needs no markup
    | …
```

Parameterized and multi-parameter containers are supported too. Substitution follows the roles of
the applied arguments: `PBox Srt Tm` changes only the `Tm` slot because `Srt` is external metadata,
while `PairBox Ty Tm` changes both syntactic slots and `PairBox Tm Nat` changes the non-final slot.

```lean
inductive PBox (Srt : Type u) (α : Type v) where
  | wrap : Srt → α → PBox Srt α

inductive PairBox (α : Type u) (β : Type v) where
  | both : α → β → PairBox α β
  | roll : PairBox α β → PairBox α β

autosubst
  Ty {Srt : Type u} where
    | marker : Srt → Ty
    | arr : Ty → Ty → Ty

  Tm {Srt : Type u} where
    | boxed : PBox Srt Tm → Tm
    | pair  : PairBox Ty Tm → Tm
    | left  : PairBox Tm Nat → Tm
```

A head that wraps a sort but *isn't* such a functor (a function space like `cod = fun α => Fin p →
α`, a non-regular type) is **rejected with a clear error**, never silently mis-threaded. See
[the capability matrix](#capability-matrix).

**Any identifier that is not a declared sort** is treated as an external (foreign) leaf type —
carried unchanged by `ren`/`subst` — regardless of case. This is how you reference ordinary Lean
types (`Nat`, `Bool`) and your own types (`mytype`, lowercase included):

```lean
| const : Nat → tm        -- `Nat` is foreign; `const c` is substitution-invariant
| lit   : mytoken → tm    -- a lowercase user type works just as well
```

The generated inductive's convenience `Repr`/`DecidableEq` instances are derived **best-effort**: a
foreign field type that lacks them (say, one with a function field) does not block generation — you
simply don't get those two instances for that sort, and can add them yourself afterwards
(`deriving instance Repr for tm`). Sorts with only ordinary fields keep them as before.

A sort with **no constructors** is a pure *variable/name* sort (only `var_<sort>`), e.g. channel
names in the π-calculus.

## Generated names (the contract)

For each substitution sort `s` (one carrying variables) with substitution vector `[v₁ … vₖ]` (the
kinds of variable `s` contains), `autosubst` emits, with these exact names:

| name                                                                           | meaning                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `s`, `var_s`                                                                   | the de Bruijn inductive and its variable constructor      |
| `congr_<sort>_<ctor>`                                                          | congruence lemma, one per non-leaf constructor            |
| `ren_s`, `subst_s`                                                             | parallel renaming/substitution (one map per `vᵢ`)         |
| `upRen_b_v`, `up_b_v`                                                          | lift a renaming/substitution through a binder of sort `b` |
| `idSubst_s`, `extRen_s`, `ext_s`                                               | `subst id = id` and extensionality                        |
| `compRenRen_s`, `compRenSubst_s`, `compSubstRen_s`, `compSubstSubst_s`         | the four fusion laws                                      |
| `rinst_inst_s`                                                                 | renaming is a special case of substitution                |
| `renRen_s`, `renSubst_s`, `substRen_s`, `substSubst_s` (+ `'` map-level forms) | clean fusion wrappers                                     |
| `instId_s`, `rinstId_s`, `varL_s`, `varLRen_s`                                 | `subst var = id`, `ren id = id`, var laws                 |

These match the upstream Autosubst names; the non-primed `instId`/`compComp…`/`rinstInst` forms are
exactly what `asimp` rewrites with. Hand-written golden references live in
[LeanAutosubst/Examples/](LeanAutosubst/Examples/) (`Stlc`, `SysF`, `StlcScoped`, `SysFScoped`,
`Container`).

## Tactics

* **`asimp`** — normalize substitution/renaming expressions to a canonical form (the σ-calculus
  normal form). Closes the standard goals: substitution identity, `ren id = id`, the four fusions,
  β-cancellation (`(ren shift s)[t..] = s`), and the substitution lemma. Variants `asimp at h` and
  `asimp at *` come for free. Implemented as `simp only [asimp_lemmas]` over the generated clean
  lemmas plus the static σ-laws ([LeanAutosubst/Tactic/Asimp.lean](LeanAutosubst/Tactic/Asimp.lean)).
* **`substify`** — rewrite renamings into substitutions (`ren_s ξ ↦ subst_s (var ∘ ξ)`) and then
  `asimp`. Variants `substify at h` / `at *`.
* **`renamify`** — the inverse of `substify`: rewrite `subst_s (var ∘ ξ) ↦ ren_s ξ` (the same
  `rinstInst'_s` identity, oriented right-to-left) and then `asimp`. Variants `renamify at h` / `at *`.
* **`auto_unfold`** — unfold the lifting helpers (`up_*` / `upRen_*` / `up_ren`), exposing the
  underlying `scons`/`funcomp`/`ren shift` machinery (no σ-calculus rewriting). Variants `at h` / `at *`.

```lean
example (s : tm) : ren_tm id s = s := by asimp
example (σ τ : Nat → tm) (s : tm) :
    subst_tm τ (subst_tm σ s) = subst_tm (funcomp (subst_tm τ) σ) s := by asimp
example (ξ : Nat → Nat) (s : tm) : subst_tm (funcomp tm.var_tm ξ) s = ren_tm ξ s := by renamify
```

`@[asimp_lemmas]` / `@[substify_lemmas]` / `@[renamify_lemmas]` / `@[auto_unfold_lemmas]` are the
underlying simp sets, should you want to add your own lemmas.

## Notations

A purely additive, opt-in readability layer mirroring upstream Autosubst's notation set
([LeanAutosubst/Prelude/Notation.lean](LeanAutosubst/Prelude/Notation.lean)). Open
`Autosubst.Notation` (unscoped) or `Autosubst.Scoped.Notation` (well-scoped) to bring them into
scope:

| notation     | meaning                          | desugars to                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `s[σ]`       | substitution application         | `subst_s σ s`                     |
| `s[σ;τ]`     | parallel (two-map) substitution  | `subst_s σ τ s`                   |
| `s⟨ξ⟩`       | renaming application             | `ren_s ξ s`                       |
| `s⟨ξ;ζ⟩`     | parallel (two-map) renaming      | `ren_s ξ ζ s`                     |
| `[σ]`, `⟨ξ⟩` | the same as functions            | `subst_s σ`, `ren_s ξ`            |
| `[a, b, c/]` | explicit finite substitution     | `a .: b .: c .: var_s`            |
| `s[a, b, c/]`| applied to `s`                   | `subst_s (a .: b .: c .: var_s) s`|
| `t..`        | single-point β-substitution      | `t .: var_s` (= `[t/]`)           |
| `↑`          | the shift renaming               | `shift`                           |
| `⇑σ`         | lift under one binder (see below)| `up_b_v σ`                        |
| `f >> g`     | forward composition (always on)  | `funcomp g f`                     |
| `s .: σ`     | cons onto a map (always on)      | `scons s σ`                       |

The `[a, b, c/]` form (the `/` marks it a *substitution*, distinct from a list literal `[a, b, c]`)
is the explicit finite substitution — a prefix of terms with an identity tail — and `s[t/]` its
single-variable application (β). It replaces the ad-hoc `inst`/`scons t var` aliases that example
files used to define by hand.

`⇑σ` is the lift of `σ` under one binder (`up_b_v σ`). It is emitted **only for single-open-sort
signatures** (STLC, the container example, the variadic test), where the binder sort `b` and
component sort `v` are both forced. In a genuinely multi-sort signature the same map type is lifted
by several binder sorts — in System F `up_tm_tm` and `up_ty_tm` are both `(Nat → tm) → (Nat → tm)` —
so no single dispatched `⇑` exists and the explicit `up_b_v` names are used (this is also why
upstream Autosubst gives `up` only a *printing* abbreviation). Parameterized sorts currently get the
raw generated operations and theorem tower, but not the notation instances; use names such as
`subst_Tm`, `ren_Tm`, and `up_Tm_Tm` directly for those signatures.

The application/function forms are **typeclass-dispatched** (`Subst1`/`Subst2`, `Ren1`/`Ren2`,
`Var`), so one notation works across all sorts; `autosubst` emits one instance per sort. Dispatch
keys on the **subject sort + map type**, and `asimp` is taught (via generated `rfl` bridge lemmas)
to normalize the notations away before rewriting, so `by asimp` closes notation'd goals unchanged.

```lean
open Autosubst Autosubst.Notation
example (t s : tm)           : (s⟨↑⟩)[t/] = s              := by asimp   -- β cancels a shift
example (σ : Nat → tm) (s : tm) : s[σ][σ] = s[σ >> [σ]]    := by asimp   -- fusion, notated
```

The notations live in **scoped namespaces** (Autosubst's `subst_scope`/`fscope`), so `↑`, `s[i]`,
`[x]`, `⟨x⟩` overload Lean's coercion / `GetElem` / list / anonymous-constructor syntax and
disambiguate by elaboration rather than clashing. In the **well-scoped** backend a *polymorphic*
constant map (`↑`, `var_s` — its scope is a metavar at the use site) needs a one-off type
ascription, e.g. `(↑ : Fin n → Fin (n+1))`; concrete map variables never do, and the unscoped
backend never needs one. See [LeanAutosubst/Examples/StlcDsl.lean](LeanAutosubst/Examples/StlcDsl.lean)
(unscoped), [SysfDsl.lean](LeanAutosubst/Examples/SysfDsl.lean) (two-map), and
[StlcScopedDsl.lean](LeanAutosubst/Examples/StlcScopedDsl.lean) (scoped).

## Capability matrix

Verified by the test suite ([tests/](tests/), built with `lake build Tests`), which ports each
reference signature from the upstream
[Autosubst 2 OCaml port](https://github.com/uds-psl/autosubst-ocaml) and asserts the tower
typechecks, is axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}` only — no `sorryAx`/`Classical.choice`), and
that representative `by asimp` goals close.

| `parameterized`                  | sort params, explicit sort refs, `opaque`, polynomial containers |      ✅⁴     |   ⛔ kernel¹    |

**¹** Nesting a container over a *scope-indexed* inductive is rejected by the Lean 4 **kernel**
(`invalid nested inductive datatype … parameters cannot contain local variables`). This is a
Lean-vs-Coq kernel difference — Coq's `-s coq` accepts the analogue — not an Autosubst/maths
limitation. Unscoped containers work fully.

**²** The variadic binder `bind ⟨p, t⟩` (a runtime count `p` of fresh variables; `lam (p : nat) :
(bind ⟨p, tm⟩ in tm) → tm` ⟶ `lam : (p : Nat) → tm (n + p) → tm n`) is supported in the
**well-scoped** backend for **single-substitution-sort** signatures
([tests/Tests/Variadic.lean](tests/Tests/Variadic.lean)), via `scons_p`/`shift_p`/`zero_p`/`upRen_p`
([LeanAutosubst/Prelude/Scoped.lean](LeanAutosubst/Prelude/Scoped.lean), index order `Fin (n + p)`).
The **unscoped** variadic form and the **multi-open-sort** scoped form are unported (explicit error).
The fixed-arity `bind a, b` multi-binder *is* supported in both backends.

**³** A user's **own inductive** becomes a container with **nothing to write** — no registration, no
attribute, no `deriving`. When `autosubst` meets a head `F …` it reads `F`'s declaration *on
demand*: if `F` is a *regular polynomial functor* in its type parameters (constructor arguments use
parameters only as elements, uniform recursive `F ...` occurrences, or not at all), it derives a
structural helper and a `congrC_F_<ctor>` congruence directly from the constructors and threads substitution through
([tests/Tests/UserContainer.lean](tests/Tests/UserContainer.lean)). `List`/`Option` go through this
*same* check — not special-cased; `Prod` is the lone inline case (binary, threaded by projections). A
sort-wrapping head that *fails* the check is rejected with an **explicit error** — a **function-space**
"functor" like `fol`'s `cod = fun α => Fin p → α` has no constructors to recurse on (asserted in
`Tests/Unsupported.lean`), never a silent miscompile.

**⁴** Parameterized sort declarations support multiple explicit/implicit Lean parameters and
explicit sort references such as `Ty Srt Ann`. Multi-parameter user containers are recognised when
they are regular polynomial functors in their type parameters; each applied argument is threaded
according to the syntax it contains, including non-final arguments. As with other containers, nesting
them over a well-scoped indexed family hits the Lean kernel limitation above. The generated raw
operations and lemmas are covered by
[tests/Tests/Parameterized.lean](tests/Tests/Parameterized.lean).

Each ⛔ above is asserted (with `#guard_msgs`) in
[tests/Tests/Unsupported.lean](tests/Tests/Unsupported.lean), so a regression to a silent success
breaks the build. A real-world integration proof — STLC progress + preservation built on the
generated operations — is in [tests/Tests/CaseStudy.lean](tests/Tests/CaseStudy.lean).

### Not modelled

Custom variable-constructor renaming (`tm(tRel)` in `utlc.sig`) — `var_<sort>` is fixed by the name
contract. Constructor/sort names must be valid Lean identifiers, so reserved tokens (`λ`) and
non-letter unicode are unavailable (a Lean lexical constraint). Autosubst's *modular* syntax feature
is out of scope (as in the OCaml port). User-defined indexed sort families beyond the well-scoped
`Nat`/`Fin` backend are also not modelled: supporting arbitrary indices would require dependent
renaming/substitution maps indexed by the source family index, rather than the current homogeneous
map vector per open sort.

## Building

```sh
lake build          # the library: the `autosubst` command + tactics + notations
lake build Tests    # the reference-signature test suite
```
